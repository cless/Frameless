[bootstrap]
defaultcontroller   = members




; These are all virtual targets
;
; A virtual target is like a symlink for a controller
; You can use this to use other names for the controller class than for the url
; for example to access http://www.example.org/list/ and link it to the Members
; controller you can create a variable named 'list' with as value 'members'
; note that list is a reserved keyword in php, but can be used as a virtual target
;
; the syntax is:
; virtualname = realname
;
