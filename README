Motivation
----------
This is a _very_ basic MVC framework that I am writing to better
understand the MVC architecture.  It is by no means meant to be a
competition for established frameworks but mostly just a research
project.
I have never used another MVC framework before creating this, this might
look very alien to someone who is used to working with those frameworks.

Files
-----
/htdocs/
    This is the whole framework and this is what should be installed in
    your web directory.

/htdocs/view/
/htdocs/view/templates
/htdocs/controller/
/htdocs/model/
    These files are example models, views and controllers and can
    (should) be replaced by your own code.


Installation
------------
For the most basic functionality you only need to copy the /htdocs/
directory and create your own views/controllers/models.  Some features
require additional libraries to be installed, these libraries are not
covered by the same license as the framework. Please see the COPYING
file for more information.

  Smarty:
     Download the latest smarty and place it in /htdocs/library/smarty/
